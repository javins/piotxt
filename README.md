         PioText - A transit tracker for Lewis & Clark College

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

     PioText is a transit tracker for Lewis & Clark College.  It
provides the school shuttle schedule through text messages.  For now,
PioText serves the schedule from a file, but eventually it will use GPS
geolocation to get realtime schedule updates.

     We're well underway now, and the service will be deployed for
Spring Semester, 2011.  In the meantime, there is a closed beta going
on.

    If you would like to know more about the project contact github user
javins.

    Developers:  If you want to compile/test/build/run piotxt, you'll
need a Java 1.6+, Apache Ant, and JUnit 4+ in a place that ant
knows about.  These are common enough that I didn't deem it necessary
to provide them.  All other required libraries are bundled in the
lib/ directory.
