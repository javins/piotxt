       Txt 4 Raz - A transit tracker for Lewis & Clark College

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

     Txt 4 Raz is a transit tracker for Lewis & Clark College.  It
provides the school shuttle schedule through sms.  For now, we serve the
schedule from a file, but  eventually we hope to use GPS geolocation to
get realtime schedule updates.

     We're well underway now, and the service will be deployed for 
Spring Semester, 2011.  In the meantime, there is a closed beta going on.

    If you would like to know more about the project contact github user
