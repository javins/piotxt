       Txt 4 Raz - A transit tracker for Lewis & Clark College

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

     Txt 4 Raz is the beginnings of a transit tracker for Lewis & Clark
College.  It will be a text message service for providing the school
shuttle schedule.  For now, we're aiming to serve the schedule from a 
file, but  eventually we hope to use GPS geolocation to get realtime
schedule updates.

     We're just getting started right now, but the service will ideally
be deployed for Fall Semester, 2010.
